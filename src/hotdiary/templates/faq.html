<p>

<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Does each user have their own virtual HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup>? How does it work?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, each user will have their own private space within which he/she can operate.  Your private information will not be accessible by anyone.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I already have a pocket electronic organizer? What is the difference?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">There are pros and cons of having an organizer. For instance you do not need an ISP account to access your pocket organizer. The advantage of using HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup>, is that you can use it from anywhere in the world, since it is internet based. Besides this is a comprehensive diary with all the features you need to conduct your business or personal life. Also, the basic service is free.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">So, can I send pager, voice, or fax message to anyone in the world?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, as long as the phone number is correct, the service will be able to dispatch your message. We support all the pagers that have internet access or have the capability to receive emails. Look at the paging section to see what pagers we support.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is included in the basic service?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can use HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> to create and publish calendars, store/access addresses, reminders and collabrum reminders or events. You can also use the email and paging service for free. Besides you have access to your own personal calendar. You can create public and personal groups for free, and even manage and share calendars for groups.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I give my login to my friends and family to use? Are there any issues?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">They could certainly access your diary if you give them your login and password.  However, we do not permit two members simultaneously logged in at the same time for security reasons.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I choose my HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> member login?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You pick the login based on your name or any other information. We will tell you if it is not unique in our database, and ask you to choose another login. Else your registration will be completed immediately.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I use the fax/voice services in HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup>?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">These can be used by upgrading your services in HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup>. Voice feature will be introduced in HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> in the near future.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why do I get automatically logged out?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">If your session is inactive for more than 60 minutes, the next time you try to access your diary, we will log you out automatically. This is for your own security, as this will prevent other users from accessing your diary, if you leave it unattended for a long time.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I don't see any pager, voice, fax and other icons in the main address menu page, when I click on the addresses? Why is it you do not have them there?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">This is a good question. We used pure HTML to design this product. This is only to help everyone in the world to use it. We could have provided this feature by giving you JavaScript, but we decided not to use JavaScript, since there are some browser incompatibilities when it comes to using it. However, we see more likely a scenario where you do not remember the the pager number of the person you want to page, until you search for his/her contact in your diary. Once you find the right contact, we see a greater chance of expecting you to click the relevant icon to dispatch the message.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I add an event to my calendar?</FONT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">In Daily view click on time (example 8:00 AM) to add an event. In monthly view click on the day of the month in the month view on the right. In weekly view click on the day of the week. For more information on calendar, please read the sections on calendars ahead in this document.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">There was a 'typo' (spelling error) in my registration. How do I fix it?</FONT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Use the Profile menu to update your registration information.<FONT>

<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana">TelTalk</FONT></H3>
<DL>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is TelTalk?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">TelTalk is technology developed by HotDiary that allows any member to send or schedule pager, fax and email messages directly using the Calendar or the Contact Manager (Address Book). Unlike traditional calendars that only support Email reminders, HotDiary supports pager and fax reminders. Voice messages will be introduced in the near future.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why is TelTalk cool?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">TelTalk breaks all barriers that you are swamped with, when you use old-fashioned organizers. If you are out fishing you are more likely to carry a pager, which reminds you, that you need to pick up your little Charles from school on the way back home. If you are running an auto-repair business, perhaps a fax reminder is more convenient. You can also use TelTalk to broadcast messages to hundreds of users via Pager, Fax or Email. These could be product announcments, mailing newsletters, stock quote charts or simply birthday invitations. Picture this...it's new year's eve of year 2000, and you would rather be partying with your friends, while HotDiary sends a New Year collabrum invitation on your behalf to hundreds of buddies. Now, that's cool!</FONT>

<a name="Paging">
<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana">Paging</FONT></H3>
<DL>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What pagers do you currently support?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">For internet paging we support SkyTel, AirTouch, Nextel, PageMart, Metrocall and other mobile devices including other pagers, and cellphones.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Is HotDiary internet paging service free?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, it's free.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Should I put the 1-800 number of SkyTel number in my diary? It did not seem to work.</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">No. You need to have the PIN number for it to work. For eg. if the PIN is "1345265". Then the number you enter in the diary should be "1345265".</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I type both numeric and alphanumeric messages?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, both will work.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">After I send the message, sometimes I see the SkyTel page in the right frame, instead of HotDiary. Is this normal?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Although this is not normal, we do not treat this as a failure necessarily. Certain characters typed in your message were not accepted by SkyTel, and hence, SkyTel did not completely process your message. This means part of your message could have been lost. If you see this happening, you should contact hotdiary.com, sending us the text of the message that you exactly typed, and we will add this to our validation documentation.</FONT>

<a name="Calendar Chat">
<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana">Calendar Chat</FONT></H3>
<DL>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is Calendar Chat?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Calendar Chat is a group service that allows multiple members of a group to simultaneously plan an event by using the Calendar like a bulletin board. For instance several members could read messages for a specific day and post comments or remarks to the calendar in real-time. In this manner a live discussion can be conducted by multiple members of a group.</FONT>

<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How is it different from a calendar?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">It's designed for chat-speed performance. It also
does not set reminders. It's more like a bulletin board, except you scribble
in a calendar.</FONT>

<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I participate in Calendar Chat?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">To participate in Calendar Chat, you need to first subscribe to your groups of interest. Read the instructions in the Groups category to learn how to do this. Once you subscribe to some groups of your interest, click MemoCal. In the Calendar Memo section, under the Group Calendar subsection, you will see a select box with all the groups that you just subscribed to. Select an appropriate group in this list, and then press the Calendar button. This will take you to in intermediate screen, where you will read further instructions and tips on how to use Calendar Chat. Once you are done reading, you can click on the link to proceed to Calendar Chat. This will take you to the Calendar Chat for the group you had selected.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Does each group have a separate Calendar Chat?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes. In fact within the same group you could have multiple chats going on for various events on different days.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why didn't we just have a regular chat?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Calendar Chat is a new concept. HotDiary is the first company to introduce this concept. A lot of our readers requested this service. Since there are a lot of members using HotDiary, a chat within a group could get really noisy! The calendar helps to separate discussions which are un-related. It also improves the quality of the messages posted, since all members are conscious that the entire community is watching them.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I would like a group calendar that allows me to announce events, but would not like anyone to change it, as you described in the chat service.</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">What you need is the HotDiary Secure Group Calendar.
Click on the Calendar button and the click on Secure Calendars, if you
would like to instantly create a secure view-by-others-only group 
calendar.<FONT>

<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Holiday, Memo and Simple Calendar allows you to store your memos on a daily basis on any day of the year. By becoming a member of HotDiary, you automatically get your own free personal calendar with built-in dates for well-known holidays. You can also use the Group Calendar provided in MemoCal
to chat with others in your group.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I view my own personal calendar?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Click on MemoCal in the left frame, and click Calendar link to view personal calendar memos.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I set a reminder from my MemoCal calendar?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">No. However, to set a reminder, you can use Hotdiary Professional Calendar (Calendar button) or use the Reminders button.</FONT></DT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">When I sign-in into HotDiary, I see two buttons, Calendar and MemoCal. What is the difference between these two calendars?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you would like to publish your calendar use the Calendar button. It's designed to have a more professional (as opposed to casual) look! The MemoCal calendar provides personal calendar, memo, holiday and  group chat services. If you would like to use your MemoCal calendar to chat with people in various groups, you can use the MemoCal group calendar.</FONT></DT>

others by showing how well you can organize your life.
</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What does Professional Calendar offer?</FONT></DT>

Professional Calendar provides a variety of useful features that include calendar publishing on the internet, customizability, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly views for Events, To-Do and Journal.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Is my calendar always published on the internet?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can choose whether to publish your calendar or not to publish. This is only an option which you can turn ON or OFF dynamically.<FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Is all my calendar information published?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can choose to publish certain events, and to-do by specifying them as public. If you select the private option for some events, we will not publish those events. For instance, if your date with your girl-friend is a private event, it will not be published. However, if you are organizing a neighbourhood picnic and would like to make this a public event, it will be published on the internet.<FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Does Professional Calendar support Teltalk?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes it does.<FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I invited a HotDiary member when I created an appointment? But the HotDiary member never got my invitation. Why is that?</FONT></DT>

<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">A group calendar is a calendar that can be used by multiple individuals at the same time.</FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What makes a group calendar useful?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">It is a place where people can plan and announce events. HotDiary makes group calendars more exciting with the addition of fax and pager based notification. This allows anyone in the group to communicate with everyone in the group by sending fax and pager notifications for events.</FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I become a group calendar master?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">When you create a group calendar, you automatically become the group calendar master for it.</FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I would like to invite my group and two more buddies to an event. Can I do this?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, you can specify the member logins or email addresses of your two buddies in the Invite Contacts section of the event.</FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I am not able to invite some HotDiary members to my group. Why is that?</FONT></DT>

<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Use the Profile menu after you login to HotDiary. There is an option to turn your calendar publishing on/off at any time.</FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I am really new to this. What is calendar publishing?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Sure, we will be glad to explain. HotDiary calendar publishing allows anyone to view HotDiary member calendars. HotDiary ensures that the calendars look identical (what-you-see-is-what-you-get). Published calendars can not only be viewed but also browsed by anyone on the Internet. Your buddie can see your published calendar in daily, weekly or monthly views for any date.</FONT>

<DL>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is the purpose of a simple memo?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you are too busy to use the Personal Calendar, you will find it easier to use the simple memo. You do not need to search by month, year or day. There is only one single memo or to-do list that is available to you. This way you can quickly read and update it as and when you need to.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Is Simple Memo my own personal memo?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes. No one other than you can access your personal memo.</FONT>

<DL>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is collabrum? I have not heard of this before?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Collabrum allows you to collaborate with other HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> members to schedule reminders.  It is possible for multiple HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> members to conduct a discussion and jointly edit the reminder.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Are the reminders and collabrums automatically deleted?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">No, we do not delete reminders automatically. We assume that you may have a reason to keep them in HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> for some time.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why do you distinguish between reminders and collabrum?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Reminders are personal in nature, generally. For instance, if you have an reminder with a dentist, you would use reminders. But if you were to schedule a football tournament with your HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> buddies, you would be more inclined to use collabrum.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I use the distribution field in the collabrum?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">The distribution field consists of all the HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> members and groups that you would like to invite to the reminder. You need to know the logins of the HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> members that you would like to add to the distribution.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I delete the collabrum if I am on the distribution?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Only if you are the owner of the collabrum.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I search for a collabrum event?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you are included in the distribution list, you should have received the ID
of the event. You need to use this ID to access your collabrum event. If you do not have an ID, you can view collabrums for a given month that you have access to, simply by pressing the Search button.</FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What's the difference between a group event and a collabrum event?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Collabrum events are multi-group events. You can even add individual members to the distribution. The other difference is, these groups need not be public groups. You can add a personal group to the distribution. The advantage of adding a personal group is that you can have just email addresses in the personal group. These need not be member logins. This is useful when you are inviting people who are not yet members of HotDiary to your collabrum event.</FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I see collabrums inside my personal calendar?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, if you are invited to a Collabrum, you will not only be able to see it in your collabrum list, but also see an appointment for it in your calendar.</FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I see collabrums inside my group calendar?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, if your group is invited to a Collabrum, you will not only be able to see it in your collabrum list, but also see an appointment for it in your group calendar.</FONT>

<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can someone add my entry to their diary?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes! This is very simple. All they need is your login, and your permission to
share your information with them. If you do it this way, anytime, your information is updated, it will automatically reflect in their diary.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I do not see icons for pager, fax, voice, url or email in my addressbook main
menu. Where are they gone?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">The main menu does not contain any entries. Entries are official in your diary only when you add them using the Add button. When you search for these entries, HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> retrieves these entries where you will see the icons.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is Fast Add?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Fast Add is a feature in HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> that allows you to add contact information of other members just by entering their member login name.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I add only HotDiary<sup><small>TM</small></sup> members to my addressbook?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can add non-members too. But there are advantages of adding members. You are guaranteed to see updated information all the time when these members change their profile. Also, you can collaborate with them.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I search for a contact in my addressbook?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Enter the first few letters of the contact name, and we will perform a search
for you. For instance, &quot;Ja&quot; could match James, and Jason, however, &quot;Jam&quot; will match only James.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Where do I enter the Middle name?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">There is no separate field for middle name. If you would like to add middle name, you can append it to the first name.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is a URL? Why do I see it in the addressbook?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">The URL stands for Uniform Resource Locater, and is typically used to point to a website, or an internet program on a website. More advanced users have learnt that they could actually execute computer tasks on the internet using this feature.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">If I share my ID, can other members view my addressbook?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">No. They can only view your contact information that is in your profile. (This ofcourse, excludes your password!). They cannot view the contacts in your diary.</FONT>

<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I am receiving a reminder, that I accidentally set as Daily and would like to turn it off. However I cannot find it in the current month?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You probably set the reminder in the previous months as Daily. You need to press the Calendar button, and browse previous months in monthly view. This way you can make your search easier and more visual. We display daily reminders only on the first day you set the reminder. This way your calendar looks less busy and more readable.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is the use of Time zone?</FONT></DT>

<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">In HotDiary, you can set the time zone per event. This means if you have a meeting in London on Dec 4th at 2 PM London Time, you simply choose this time zone for the event. This way you do not have to convert your meeting time in London to your current time zone which could be Eastern Time.</FONT>

<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What are the different types of Groups in HotDiary?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">There are only two types of groups in HotDiary, public groups and personal groups.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is a public group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">A public group is visible to every member in HotDiary, hence everyone on the internet can access it. Any HotDiary member can subscribe to a public group by using the Join feature or unsubscribe from it by using the Leave feature.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is a personal group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">A personal group is visible only to the member who created it. It behaves like a personal mail alias. Only the owner (who creates the personal group) can add members and email addresses to the group. Even the members in the personal group do not have access to this group, since it is not even visible to them.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Who is the founder of a group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">The founder of a group is the member who created a public group using the Add feature. Only the founder can delete a group. The founder can delete a group even if some members have subscribed to the group. In such an event, all the members who had subscribed to this group no longer can access this group. A founder is automatically subscribed to the founded group when he/she creates this group. Also, a founder cannot leave a group that he/she has founded.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is an unsubscribed group? Subscribed group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">An unsubscribed group is a public group, that has not been subscribed to by the current user. It is possible for a new member to subscribe to such a group by using the Join feature.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I create a public group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">In the Groups menu, enter the Group Name. Ignore the Personal Groups select box. Select the Group Type as anything other than Personal. (It does not matter). Enter a Group Title and a Group Charter and press the Add button.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Do group names need to be unique?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Group names need to be unique amoung public groups, private groups and also unique from HotDiary member login names. We did this because, you can unambiguously decide to collaborate and communicate with various groups of public and private nature, and also individual members without having to worry about accidentally setting an event for a complete group instead of an individual member. If a group name in your distribution clashed with a member login name, you may un-intentionally set the event for an entire group.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I search for a group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Select the appropriate Group Type, and enter the first few letters of the group name you are looking for and press the Search button.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I add members to a public group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You cannot add members to a public group. You can only add yourself to a public group by using the Join feature.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I manage members in my personal group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Search for the group by entering the keyword and selecting grouptype as Personal. Click on the group you would like to manage, and press the Manage button.</FONT>
