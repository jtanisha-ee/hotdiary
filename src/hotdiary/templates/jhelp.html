<DL>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I would like to use :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup>? What do I need to do?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">All you have to do is access our main webpage, and click on register. Fill out your profile information, and you are ready to go!</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I change my personal information? Or information that I entered when I registered with :$label:.</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Login into :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup>. On the first page, in the left frame, click on the profile button. Update the profile in the right frame, and press update when you are done.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">When I try to retrieve my password using the forgot password utility, it says, that my email does not match the one in the records. Why is that?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, the email you specify must match the one that we have in our records, at the time you registered. If the email address you had specified was invalid, we erase your email address, as we do not permit invalid email addresses in our database. If email sent to your email address at time of registration or as a email reminder rebounds due to "user unknown" error, we typically erase your email address. To re-activate your account, you need to <a href="http://www.hotdiary.com/contact_us.html">contact us</a> at HotDiary.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How much does it cost to use your basic service?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">The basic :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup> service is free!</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What can I do with :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup>?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can use it to create and publish calendars, store and access addresses, reminders and collabrums. You can also use it to send and schedule pager, fax, and email messages just by clicking an entry in your diary. In additon, you can create and join public, personal and secure groups. You can use them to access various group calendars and use calendar chat services.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Does each user have their own virtual :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup>? How does it work?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, each user will have their own private space within which he/she can operate.  Your private information will not be accessible by anyone.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I already have a pocket electronic organizer? What is the difference?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">There are pros and cons of having an organizer. For instance you do not need an ISP account to access your pocket organizer. The advantage of using :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup>, is that you can use it from anywhere in the world, since it is internet based. Besides this is a comprehensive diary with all the features you need to conduct your business or personal life. Also, the basic service is free.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">So, can I send pager, voice, or fax message to anyone in the world?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, as long as the phone number is correct, the service will be able to dispatch your message. We support all the pagers that have internet access or have the capability to receive emails. Look at the paging section to see what pagers we support.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is included in the basic service?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Check out http://www.hotdiary.com/free_services.html for more information on basic services.
</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I give my login to my friends and family to use? Are there any issues?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">They could certainly access your diary if you give them your login and password.  However, we do not permit two members simultaneously logged in at the same time for security reasons.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I choose my :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup> member login?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You pick the login based on your name or any other information. We will tell you if it is not unique in our database, and ask you to choose another login. Else your registration will be completed immediately.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I use the fax/voice services in :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup>?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">These can be used by upgrading your services in :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup>. Voice feature will be introduced in :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup> in the near future.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why do I get automatically logged out?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">If your session is inactive for more than 60 minutes, the next time you try to access your diary, we will log you out automatically. This is for your own security, as this will prevent other users from accessing your diary, if you leave it unattended for a long time.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I don't see any pager, voice, fax and other icons in the main address menu page, when I click on the addresses? Why is it you do not have them there?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">This is a good question. We used pure HTML to design this product. This is only to help everyone in the world to use it. We could have provided this feature by giving you JavaScript, but we decided not to use JavaScript, since there are some browser incompatibilities when it comes to using it. However, we see more likely a scenario where you do not remember the the pager number of the person you want to page, until you search for his/her contact in your diary. Once you find the right contact, we see a greater chance of expecting you to click the relevant icon to dispatch the message.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I add an event to my calendar?</FONT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">In Daily view click on time (example 8:00 AM) to add an event. In monthly view click on the day of the month in the month view on the right. In weekly view click on the day of the week. For more information on calendar, please read the sections on calendars ahead in this document.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">There was a 'typo' (spelling error) in my registration. How do I fix it?</FONT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Use the Profile menu to update your registration information.<FONT>

<DL>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is TelTalk?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">TelTalk is technology developed by :$label: that allows any member to send or schedule pager, fax and email messages directly using the Calendar or the Contact Manager (Address Book). Unlike traditional calendars that only support Email reminders, :$label: supports pager and fax reminders. Voice messages will be introduced in the near future.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why is TelTalk cool?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">TelTalk breaks all barriers that you are swamped with, when you use old-fashioned organizers. If you are out fishing you are more likely to carry a pager, which reminds you, that you need to pick up your little Charles from school on the way back home. If you are running an auto-repair business, perhaps a fax reminder is more convenient. You can also use TelTalk to broadcast messages to hundreds of users via Pager, Fax or Email. These could be product announcments, mailing newsletters, stock quote charts or simply birthday invitations. Picture this...it's new year's eve of year 2000, and you would rather be partying with your friends, while :$label: sends a New Year collabrum invitation on your behalf to hundreds of buddies. Now, that's cool!</FONT>

<DL>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What are community events?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Community events are public events relevant to various communities. :$label: has created many useful communities for your benefit. Some of these include Arts, Technology, and Business and more. Community calendars are special :$label: calendars maintained by :$label: Inc. Unlike other companies, :$label: allows visitors to add their own events to the community calendar for FREE!</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I browse :$label: communities?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">You can browse :$label: communities by starting your journey at http://www.hotdiary.com/comevents.html. There are several community calendars created for your instant perusal.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I would like to announce events in my club. Can I use :$label: community calendars to do this?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes you can. Click on "I would like to promote my business" and choose a relevant category for your event.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Are all announcements published instantly?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes all announcements are published in real-time. However we do moderate the content of our calendars. So published events may be removed if they are found to be irrelevant, incorrect, or even contain obscene or foul language.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How are you different from classifieds?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">We categorize your events by time, and use our professional calendaring tool to host your events. There are many useful classifieds sites on the internet and we believe there is a place for their market. However, our audience would find us useful in situations where you need to search for events.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Is your service free?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, our service is free for not only the end-users who view or subscribe to event calendars, but also businesses who would like to promote their events on our calendars.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I use your calendars to sell my products?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Implicitly. You can use our calendars to schedule your product announcements on specific dates. However, this is not a free store or an e-commerce center where you can sell your products. We suggest that you upload your event banner, and create a link back to your website, where you could sell your products or services.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Will you be adding more categories?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, we will be adding more categories depending on the feedback we get. We also may add sub-categories.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I create my own category or community?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">You can create a public group calendar that resembles a community. However, currently you cannot create your own community category that is accessible from our community page. We will be adding this feature soon.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Will your service always be free?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Our service will always be free for end-users. However, we may decide to charge money for businesses.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I just added an event, however I have made an error in entry. How can I fix it?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">When you add an event, we will provide you with an event key that you should store in a safe place for future reference. You must send email to <a href="http://www.hotdiary.com/contact_us.html">this</a> and request us to fix the event. Make sure you mention the community calendar name and the key, in order for us to expedite your processing. We will usually correct the event for you within 24 hours. Please bear with us, if there are delays, we receive many requests everyday.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why don't you allow me to fix the problem in my event?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Community calendars are maintained by :$label: and are not editable by anyone. This is to protect the content and quality of the calendars.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I need to add events everyday, and I prefer doing this non-interactively. Do you have software that allows us to feed events in to your system?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes we do. If you would like to be an event-feeder, please contact hotdiary.com. We will provide you with the software needed to help you feed events in to our system.

<DL>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is <i>My Downtown</i>?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana"><i>My Downtown</i> is a business-to-business planning solution aimed at vertical market segments. This is ideal for businesses, non-profit organizations, institutions, associations and similar entities. It is a B2B enabler, and is appropriate for businesses who like to do planning, and scheduling within themselves, as well as with customers, resellers, wholesalers, retailers, third-party vendors, and business partners.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I do not have a business? Can I use this for my club?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Don't take the word Business too seriously! It only means you have an entity that is more than just a group. For instance, you feel the need to create multiple teams within your club and have them all use an office tools center to collaboratively work.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I successfully use a community?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">For best results, we suggest that you create a real community representing your actual work environment with atleast a few members. If you have less than a few members, <i>My Downtown</i> may not provide many advantages. In such an event you can create a private group instead.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is a team? How is it different from a <i>My Downtown</i> community?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">A team (or project team) can have multiple members. A <i>My Downtown</i> community typically consists of one or more project teams.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is a business calendar? How is it different from a regular calendar?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">A business calendar is a team or project calendar. It is similar to a group calendar, however is protected within an organization, and can be accessed only by it's employees or members.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can anyone join <i>My Downtown</i>?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">If a business is listed, any :$label: members can search for it, else they need to know the exact name. With :$label:, you can send a join request to a <i>My Downtown</i> community. If your request is accepted, it means you have successfully joined this community.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can anyone leave a <i>My Downtown</i> business community?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Is there a difference between member directories and other business directories?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, member directories are special. They are typically the employees or members who work very closely with your <i>My Downtown</i> community. </FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Is <i>My Downtown</i> a free service? If not, how much does it cost?</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Verdana">It is not free. Rates vary based on your business needs. However, to open a <i>My Downtown</i> business account rates start at US $150.00. There is also a fixed monthly minimum cost of US $20.00 per business member.</FONT>

</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I belong to more than one <i>My Downtown</i> community?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, you can. In fact, that's where the benefits of B2B start kicking in! Our basic premise is that you do not do business in isolation. In order to run a successful business, you need to collaborate, plan and communicate with other businesses. Not only do you depend on these businesses for your planning and success, but the vice-versa is true. They depend on you to do their business.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I use JavaScript on my JiveIt! page?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, you can insert JavaScript on the front page,
as well as all the template pages. JavaScript tends to have compatibility
issues. HotDiary does not support JiveIt! sites that do not function
correctly because of improper use of JavaScript that interacts with
the quality of navigation or use of the browser.</FONT>
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I host websites, and each of my users
may want to have their own JiveIt! site hosted. Do you charge me for
the license?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">No, we charge you for only one license per domain.
If there are several JiveIt! sites hosted on your site, no charges
apply. However, if you are a reseller and would like sell JiveIt!
to your members, we pay 20% commission on all sales that go 
through your domain.
</DD>
<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Do I have access to my JiveIt! member database?</FONT>
</DT>
<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, you do. When you login as admin for your JiveIt! site using the URL: http://1800calendar.com/cgi-bin/execjiveitadmin.cgi?jp=member 
where "member" is your member ID, you can click on "My Members" links to
view information about all members who have registered on your site. You
can choose to display summary or detail information. You are bound to
follow the HotDiary's privacy policy notice at: http://www.hotdiary.com/privacy_policy.html, if you decide to contact your members. All entries in red

<p>
<DT>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Who owns the JiveIt! members that register from our site?</FONT>

<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">This is a good question. Our answer may vary depending on your requirements. If your member registry is strictly for private use of your company, HotDiary will give you complete ownership of this registry. However, since the members register using a service that is built by us, you need to accept all the terms of the privacy policy with respect to contacting your own members.

<DD>
<FONT FACE="Verdana">Although this is not normal, we do not treat this as a failure necessarily. Certain characters typed in your message were not accepted by SkyTel, and hence, SkyTel did not completely process your message. This means part of your message could have been lost. If you see this happening, you should contact hotdiary.com, sending us the text of the message that you exactly typed, and we will add this to our validation documentation.</FONT>

<DL>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is Calendar Chat?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Calendar Chat is a group service that allows multiple members of a group to simultaneously plan an event by using the Calendar like a bulletin board. For instance several members could read messages for a specific day and post comments or remarks to the calendar in real-time. In this manner a live discussion can be conducted by multiple members of a group.</FONT>

<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How is it different from a calendar?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">It's designed for chat-speed performance. It also
does not set reminders. It's more like a bulletin board, except you scribble
in a calendar.</FONT>

<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I participate in Calendar Chat?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">To participate in Calendar Chat, you need to first subscribe to your groups of interest. Read the instructions in the Groups category to learn how to do this. Once you subscribe to some groups of your interest, click MemoCal. In the Calendar Memo section, under the Group Calendar subsection, you will see a select box with all the groups that you just subscribed to. Select an appropriate group in this list, and then press the Calendar button. This will take you to in intermediate screen, where you will read further instructions and tips on how to use Calendar Chat. Once you are done reading, you can click on the link to proceed to Calendar Chat. This will take you to the Calendar Chat for the group you had selected.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Does each group have a separate Calendar Chat?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes. In fact within the same group you could have multiple chats going on for various events on different days.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why didn't we just have a regular chat?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Calendar Chat is a new concept. :$label: is the first company to introduce this concept. A lot of our readers requested this service. Since there are a lot of members using :$label:, a chat within a group could get really noisy! The calendar helps to separate discussions which are un-related. It also improves the quality of the messages posted, since all members are conscious that the entire community is watching them.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I would like a group calendar that allows me to announce events, but would not like anyone to change it, as you described in the chat service.</FONT></DT>

Settings. Make sure you have specified reminder type as Email and not Pager or Fax. It is possible that all the above are true, but your mailbox could be full and your mail server may have rejected incoming emails. If you contact us, we can confirm if that is the case, because we get the return email from your mail server, when such an error occurs. Also, make sure your mail server is not down. Other possibilities include network failures in and around your network.</FONT>

If you do not have any other reminders that you would like to keep, you can choose to reset your calendar completely. This is done by clicking on the Home link on the calendar page, and then clicking on My Calendar Preferences. On this page you will see the reset option for your calendar. The reset command is a powerful command, it will erase all your reminders, and you can undo this operation. So you may want to use this option with care.</FONT>

They can choose to not activate their memberships. But if they activate their account, based on the information they receive in the email message, they can see that the same event has been added to their personal calendar or My Calendar. Make sure you trust and know your friends, and they know you too. Else they will be surprised to receive your email. Follow the HotDiary member agreement. If you would like to invite existing members to HotDiary who are your friends, you can enter their member ID. This will automatically add the event to their  personal calendar, if they have chosen to make their ID public. If they have not chosen to make their ID public, they will not be contacted, and their calendars will not be modified. Again, make sure that they know you well, before you do this. Note that you can intermix member IDs and emails in your invitation list, as long as you separate them by commas.</FONT>

<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Are the reminders and collabrums automatically deleted?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">No, we do not delete reminders automatically. We assume that you may have a reason to keep them in :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup> for some time.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why do you distinguish between reminders and collabrum?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Reminders are personal in nature, generally. For instance, if you have an reminder with a dentist, you would use reminders. But if you were to schedule a football tournament with your :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup> buddies, you would be more inclined to use collabrum.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I use the distribution field in the collabrum?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">The distribution field consists of all the :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup> members and groups that you would like to invite to the reminder.

<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What's the difference between a group event and a collabrum event?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Collabrum events are multi-group events. You can even add individual members to the distribution. The other difference is, these groups need not be public groups. You can add a personal group to the distribution. The advantage of adding a personal group is that you can have just email addresses in the personal group. These need not be member logins. This is useful when you are inviting people who are not yet members of :$label: to your collabrum event.</FONT>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I see collabrums inside my personal calendar?</FONT></DT>

share your information with them. If you do it this way, anytime, your information is updated, it will automatically reflect in their diary.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I do not see icons for pager, fax, voice, url or email in my addressbook main
menu. Where are they gone?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">The main menu does not contain any entries. Entries are official in your diary only when you add them using the Add button. When you search for these entries, :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup> retrieves these entries where you will see the icons.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is Fast Add?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Fast Add is a feature in :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup> that allows you to add contact information of other members just by entering their member login name.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can I add only :$label:<sup><small>TM</small></sup> members to my addressbook?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can add non-members too. But there are advantages of adding members. You are guaranteed to see updated information all the time when these members change their profile. Also, you can collaborate with them.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I search for a contact in my addressbook?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Enter the first few letters of the contact name, and we will perform a search
for you. For instance, &quot;Ja&quot; could match James, and Jason, however, &quot;Jam&quot; will match only James.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Where do I enter the Middle name?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">There is no separate field for middle name. If you would like to add middle name, you can append it to the first name.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is a URL? Why do I see it in the addressbook?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">The URL stands for Uniform Resource Locater, and is typically used to point to a website, or an internet program on a website. More advanced users have learnt that they could actually execute computer tasks on the internet using this feature.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">If I share my ID, can other members view my addressbook?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">No. They can only view your contact information that is in your profile. (This ofcourse, excludes your password!). They cannot view the contacts in your diary.</FONT>

<DL>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is Group Address Book?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Group Address Book allows you to manage contacts in your group. So if you have a group called <i>camping</i>, everyone in this group could share a set of contacts. And these may include not just the addresses of the people in the group, but also contacts of camp clubs, associations, camping equipment retail stores and so on.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I have created a group. How do I enable this feature?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Select the Manage Groups link once you are logged in, and select the group you created. Select the <i>Public Edit</i> option. If this is already turned on, you may want to explicitly turn it off, and then turn it on. This will activate your group contact manager and assign your group contacts a web address like <i>http://www.hotdiary.com/contacts/mygroup</i>. From now onwards you can access your group contacts even without signing in to HotDiary.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Can anyone access my group website, and edit my group contacts?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you need a secure group access, you can always assign a password to your group. This will prevent people from accessing your group contacts, as they must know the password.</FONT>

<a name="Reminders">
<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana">Reminders</FONT></H3>

<DL>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I search for reminders?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can specify the month of the reminders, to search for all reminders in this month.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">I am receiving a reminder, that I accidentally set as Daily and would like to turn it off. However I cannot find it in the current month?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You probably set the reminder in the previous months as Daily. You need to press the Calendar button, and browse previous months in monthly view. This way you can make your search easier and more visual. We display daily reminders only on the first day you set the reminder. This way your calendar looks less busy and more readable.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is the use of Time zone?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Time zone allows you to set reminders in any country in the world. This way you do not need to worry about the time differences. </FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Why didn't I receive my reminder?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Check the alarm type you specified i.e. Email/Pager/Fax. Then check if you have specified the correct Email/Pager/Fax in your Profile.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I set the occurrence for my reminder?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can set this using the Frequency option as daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What's unique about :$label: Timezones?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">In :$label:, you can set the time zone per event. This means if you have a meeting in London on Dec 4th at 2 PM London Time, you simply choose this time zone for the event. This way you do not have to convert your meeting time in London to your current time zone which could be Eastern Time.</FONT>

<a name="Groups">
<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana">Groups</FONT></H3>
<DL>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What are the different types of Groups in :$label:?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">There are only two types of groups in :$label:, public groups and personal groups.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is a public group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">A public group is visible to every member in :$label:, hence everyone on the internet can access it. Any :$label: member can subscribe to a public group by using the Join feature or unsubscribe from it by using the Leave feature.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is a personal group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">A personal group is visible only to the member who created it. It behaves like a personal mail alias. Only the owner (who creates the personal group) can add members and email addresses to the group. Even the members in the personal group do not have access to this group, since it is not even visible to them.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Who is the founder of a group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">The founder of a group is the member who created a public group using the Add feature. Only the founder can delete a group. The founder can delete a group even if some members have subscribed to the group. In such an event, all the members who had subscribed to this group no longer can access this group. A founder is automatically subscribed to the founded group when he/she creates this group. Also, a founder cannot leave a group that he/she has founded.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">What is an unsubscribed group? Subscribed group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">An unsubscribed group is a public group, that has not been subscribed to by the current user. It is possible for a new member to subscribe to such a group by using the Join feature.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I create a public group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">In the Groups menu, enter the Group Name. Ignore the Personal Groups select box. Select the Group Type as anything other than Personal. (It does not matter). Enter a Group Title and a Group Charter and press the Add button.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">Do group names need to be unique?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Group names need to be unique amoung public groups, private groups and also unique from :$label: member login names. We did this because, you can unambiguously decide to collaborate and communicate with various groups of public and private nature, and also individual members without having to worry about accidentally setting an event for a complete group instead of an individual member. If a group name in your distribution clashed with a member login name, you may un-intentionally set the event for an entire group.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I search for a group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Select the appropriate Group Type, and enter the first few letters of the group name you are looking for and press the Search button.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I add members to a public group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">You cannot add members to a public group. You can only add yourself to a public group by using the Join feature.</FONT>
<p>
<DT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="5">How do I manage members in my personal group?</FONT></DT>
<DD><FONT FACE="Verdana">Search for the group by entering the keyword and selecting grouptype as Personal. Click on the group you would like to manage, and press the Manage button.</FONT>
