<h3><FONT FACE="Verdana">Advanced Template Customization <a href="#topofpage">Go Back</a></FONT></h3>
<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Use this section if you have some knowledge of HTML. Every page on
JiveIt! HotDiary portal is customizable. For instance you can decide
to change the layout of the address book page. Another example is
you can change the layout of your Notes page. This could involve
changing fonts, colors, adding backgrounds, adding images, changing
layout of page, adding hyperlinks (or bookmarks) to other web sites
or even adding Java or Javascript. There are no limits to the amount
of customization available. The only limit is your expertise. Changing
layout involves the following:

<h4>Create a JiveIt! Portal <a href="#helpindex">Go Back</a></h4>
<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT SIZE=4>
<a href="http://www.hotdiary.com/register.html" target=_main>Register</a> with 
HotDiary. Point your browser to <a href="http://www.hotdiary.com/jiveitauth.shtml" target=_main>JiveIt Portal</a>. Login into the page, and you will see
a basic customization page, that includes customizing the logo, title,
banner and some images on the top page. You can enter the name of your
own web site or home page, title, logo and any ad banner if applicable.
If you are not sure, you can leave the field as it is. Note that you
can always change these fields later, after you create the portal.
At the bottom of the page, you will see a Submit button. Press this
button, and you will now see a page congratulating you for creating
the portal. You will also see a number of useful hyperlinks on this
page. This is a good time to take a pause, and print the page. This
page may be useful later to you when you would like to access your
JiveIt! site.
</FONT>
</p>
<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT SIZE=4>
If your JiveIt! website bookmark is too complicated, here's an easy
way to remember it. Just look at the bookmark below:<br>
http://www.1800calendar.com/index.cgi?jp=buddie<br>
This is how your bookmark will look. The only difference is the word
following "jp=". This is the word corresponding to your JiveIt! member
ID. Your JiveIt! member ID is the same as your HotDiary member login.
So in order to goto your website, all you need to remember is to access
this URL above, with your member ID in place of "buddie".
</FONT>
</p>

<a name="Identify">
<h4>Identify the Changes <a href="#helpindex">Go Back</a></h4>
<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Now that you are familiar with your JiveIt! website, just point your
browser to this site. So if your member ID is "jack", you should point
your website to:<br>
http://www.1800calendar.com/index.cgi?jp=jack<br>
Login as yourself, on the front page, using your member ID and password.
Note that anyone can register on your site, and login with their own
member ID! You are the administrator for this site. They will not be 
able to login as you, unless they know your member ID. So you are all
excited by now, as you have developed not just a web page, but a live
portal with your own look and feel. You will soon learn that you
can customize every page of this portal.
</FONT>
</p>
<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Once you login, you can browse through the pages of your own site, and
see if you like it. Chances are you may want to change a few things
on some pages. We expect this, as we know every JiveIt! administrator
would like control over customizing different pages of the portal.
We also recognize that you may not be interested in writing any 
complicated programs to do this. However, you are pretty much 
conversant with the idea of HTML, and you are able to take existing
pages (or templates) and customize them on your PC using your own 
web authoring tool or HTML word processor.
</FONT>
</p>

<a name="Downloading">

<h4>Downloading the template <a href="#helpindex">Go Back</a></h4>
<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT SIZE=4>
So let's say you would like to customize the memo page. You can
point your browser to:<br>
<a href="http://www.hotdiary.com/downloadtemplates.html" target=_main>Download Templates</a><br>
and scroll down the page, until you find the link to "Memo Manager".
You can read the description on the right hand side, which will help
you to identify the page (or template name) you want by looking for the
functionality you would like to customize. Click on the "Memo Manager"
link. On some browsers this will pop up a File Manager window.
On some others, it may not do this. In such case, try to press the
SHIFT key on your keyboard at the same time as clicking on the link.
If this still does not popup a file manager window, you may need to
cut and paste the text on the Memo Manager page, and save it to a
file on your disk. You can even rename this file to a ".html" file.
This will allow you to edit the file using a web authoring tool,
or an HTML editor, or simply any text editor, like wordpad, or notepad.
Edit this HTML file carefully without damaging any of the links in
it. You can however delete some links completely if you wish. This
is usually done on the "Application Home" page. If you are a first
time user, we suggest this is the only page, where you can delete
links to applications that you do not need. For instance, if you
dont need the calendar, you can delete links to the calendar. However
to change the links on other templates, you need considerable 
expertise. Adding your own links on the other pages, on the other 
hand is not very difficult.
</FONT>
</p>

<a name="Uploading">

<h4>Uploading the modified template <a href="#helpindex">Go Back</a></h4>
<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Once you have modified the template, you are ready to upload it.
Point your browser to:<br>
http://www.1800calendar.com/index.cgi?jp=member<br>
Where member ID above is substituted with your member ID. Click
on the Admin link on the resultant page. This will show a page,
where it will say "This site is administered by...". Login
as the administrator for this site. The password is the same 
password you used to create the JiveIt! site, and is the same
password that you use to login to HotDiary with your member ID.
After you login, you will see the links to "Upload My Templates".
You can now click on the link. By this time, you should know
the name of the file you have saved on your local PC disk.
Click on the Browse button, and select the path where this file is
located. Select the Template Type, as "Memo". Be careful which
template type you choose. If you select the wrong template type,
you may overwrite a different template on HotDiary with your
modified template. This may make your portal look "weird". If
you do happen to accidentally do this, you can click on "Download
Templates", and download the original template corresponding
to Memo Manager again, and upload this template once again.
Note that the downloaded files will have the suffix of ".txt".
However the file you want to upload can have any suffix. After
you upload the file, we interpret the file as if it were an
".html" file.
</FONT>
</p>

<a name="Testing">

<h4>Testing the changes <a href="#helpindex">Go Back</a></h4>
<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Once you have successfully uploaded the template, you need to
test if your changes are in effect. Point your browser to:<br>
http://www.1800calendar.com/index.cgi?jp=member</br>
where the member name above is substituted with your member ID.
Login to the portal, and click on the Memo link, and see if
the page you see is the once you customize. If the page looks
garbled, chances are that the HTML changes you made have 
incorrectly been made, or gone through. This is where your expertise
in HTML may be useful. If you would like to make a lot of changes
you really need to understand HTML well.
